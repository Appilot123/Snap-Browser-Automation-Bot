<h1 align="center">Snap Browser Automation Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

Snap-Browser-AutomationBot is a stealth browser automation tool designed to simulate human-like activity on Snap-based platforms—whether you're targeting Snapchat web features, SnapEarn platforms, or other Snap-branded environments. Built as a lightweight browser extension, the tool allows users to execute custom tasks like login, view loops, button clicks, daily check-ins, or rewards farming without triggering bot detection.

It’s especially handy for marketers, power users, and automation enthusiasts who need repeatable, trackable actions done across multiple accounts—without babysitting the browser.


## Core Features:
- **Stealth Extension Automation**: Mimics real human behavior through an undetectable browser extension.
- **Customizable Workflows**: Define your own action sequences (click, wait, scroll, etc.) with easy-to-edit scripts.
- **Scalable Multi-Session Support**: Run multiple Snap sessions using isolated browser profiles + proxy integration
